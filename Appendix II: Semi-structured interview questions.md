1. **Basic questions**
* Are you currently renting your land? How many acres are you renting? How many parcels of land do you have in total?
* Is it rented from one family? What is your relationship with the owner? Are you renting from a relative? Or did you rent from an acquaintance/neighbor?
* From an acquaintance/neighbor?
* Is there any land that you are allowed to rent from the sumu? If so, are there any rules? How did you draw lots?
 
2. **Distance**
* Are there any land available for renting nearby? How far is it? (Is it 10 miles?)
* If it's far, how do you get your livestock there?
* Do you think it would be a problem for you if the rented land is far away? What do you think is the best distance?
* Do you think it would affect you to go to the rented pasture while passing through someone else's pasture?

3. **Do you have winter and summer camps in your own pasture?**
* How many months a year do you graze on it?
* How many months do you graze on your own pasture? What is the main purpose (e.g., hay harvesting/grazing)?
* (Only for Winter and summer herders) Why do you choose to have two camps? Does it give you any advantage?
* Do you think it has made a difference to you to transition from a four-season camp decades ago to one camp (no longer migrate)? Do you think it has any effect on you? 

4. **Length of time**
* How long do you rent the land now? From what year to what year (season)?
* Do you think you are renting the land for a sufficient amount of time? 

5. **Renewal of lease**
* If expires, do you want to renew the lease from the same person who is renting to you now? Why? Do you think it will be easy for you to renew the lease?
* What if you can't renew it?
* Do you think it is important for you to renew the lease? 

6. **Price**
* What is the price you are renting?
* Is this the average price for the area? Does the price vary a lot?
* Do you pay once a year? Is it a lump sum payment for several years? Has lump sum payment always been available, or is it a recent practice?

7. **Reasons**
* Why did you start renting the land?
* Will the cost of the sheep go down a bit if you rent the land?
* Can you rent land for hay harvesting?
* Do you think renting pasture in the past five years has been competitive? If so, why do you think is the reason?
* During the years you rented rangeland, were you always able to get the rangeland you wanted? Were you able to do so in previous years? If not, which years and why?
* What would you have done if you had not been able to rent enough pasture?
* Did people from outside the gacha come in to graze? Do you think it would affect you? If people from outside the gacha are not allowed to graze, Do you think this is a good idea?

9. **Agreement**
* Did you use a verbal agreement or a personal(formal) agreement?
* (For those who did not use a formal contract) Does it affect you without a written contract?

10. **The possibility of renting to others**
* Has it ever happened to you that the same piece of land you rented was rented to several people?
* Has there ever been a case where the landlord took back the land before the contract expired?
* Has there been any case that someone's livestock came into your rented pasture and grazed?

11. **The possibility of premature termination**
* Do you think it is possible for the landlord to withdraw (break) the contract early? 

12. **Restrictions on the leased land by the head of the household**
* Is it possible to harvest hay on the rented land? (Are there people who rent haying fields)? What is the price? What is the difference between the land you rent and the land you hay?
* Does the owner have any requirements on how you can use the pasture?
* Are there any requirements listed in the contract?
* For example, can you drill a well on it? Can you build a shed? Can you sublease it to someone else?

13. **What are your criteria for choosing land for lease?**
* When renting a piece of land, what is the most important condition you look for besides grass? 

14. **Village community**
* Some people suggest that people who go to the city can rent the land to the gacha, and then the gacha can rent it to the herders, just like in the farming area. Do you think you would be willing to rent from the village community? Why?

15. **Security**
* Do you think the presence of coal mines nearby will affect you?
* Have there been any conflicts over rangeland near your home? If so, how did they finally settle? What do you define as an "otor"? Do you consider the land rental transaction to be an "otor"?
